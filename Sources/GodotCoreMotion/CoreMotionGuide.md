# Using Apple's CoreMotion APIs with Godot

This is a guide on using the CoreMotion APIs in this Godot addon. For
an overview of what you can do with CoreMotion, check [Apple's
CoreMotion Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/).

As with the rest of GodotApplePlugins, the binding surfaces the same
class names that Apple uses for their own data types to simplify
looking things up and finding resources online. Method names follow
the Godot naming scheme (snake_case instead of camelCase).

# Available Types

The CoreMotion binding is documented in `doc_classes/` and in the
published API reference. The surface includes:

## Motion (handheld device)

* `CMMotionManager` — entry point for accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and fused device motion
* `CMAccelerometerData` — a raw accelerometer sample
* `CMGyroData` — a raw gyroscope sample
* `CMMagnetometerData` — a raw magnetometer sample
* `CMDeviceMotion` — fused attitude, gravity, user acceleration, rotation rate, and magnetic field

## Headphone Motion

* `CMHeadphoneMotionManager` — head motion from AirPods and other compatible headphones (re-uses `CMDeviceMotion`)

## Pedometer

* `CMPedometer` — step, distance, floor, pace, and cadence counts
* `CMPedometerData` — a single pedometer reading covering a time window

## Altimeter

* `CMAltimeter` — barometric pressure-based altitude
* `CMAltitudeData` — a relative altitude / pressure sample
* `CMAbsoluteAltitudeData` — a sea-level-referenced altitude sample (iOS 15+)

## Activity Classification

* `CMMotionActivityManager` — classifies the user's current activity
* `CMMotionActivity` — one classification (walking, running, automotive, cycling, stationary, unknown) with a confidence level

# Info.plist and Permissions

Most CoreMotion APIs are permission-gated. You need at least:

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This game uses motion data to ...</string>
```

The `NSMotionUsageDescription` key covers `CMMotionManager` (accelerometer/gyroscope/magnetometer/device motion), `CMPedometer`, `CMAltimeter`, `CMMotionActivityManager`, and `CMHeadphoneMotionManager`. The first time your project starts updates on any of these, iOS prompts the user; the user's decision is reported via the `authorization_status()` static methods (where applicable).

# Choosing Between Raw Sensors and Device Motion

The raw `start_accelerometer_updates()` / `start_gyro_updates()` / `start_magnetometer_updates()` deliver the device's unprocessed sensor readings — accelerometer values include gravity, gyroscope values include drift bias, and magnetometer values include local magnetic interference.

`start_device_motion_updates()` runs Apple's sensor fusion pipeline and gives you:

* **Attitude** as both a `Quaternion` and roll/pitch/yaw Euler angles
* **Gravity** and **user acceleration** separated from one another
* **Bias-corrected rotation rate**
* **Bias-corrected magnetic field** with a calibration-accuracy enum

For almost all gameplay use cases (head/device tilt, shake detection, motion-controlled cameras), `CMDeviceMotion` is what you want. Reach for the raw streams only when you need very high sample rates or you're doing custom sensor fusion.

# Platform Notes

* **iOS** — Full support for every type in this binding.
* **macOS** — `CMHeadphoneMotionManager` works on macOS 14+ (returns motion from connected AirPods). The other managers are surfaced but their `is_*_available` static methods return `false` and starting updates emits a `*_failed` signal with a "not available" message — this matches Apple's own coverage, since CoreMotion sensors require an iPhone or Apple Watch.
* **visionOS** — All managers are surfaced as non-operational stubs. Use the visionOS-native ARKit `WorldTrackingProvider` (via `ARSession` in this package) for head pose instead.
* **Linux / Windows** — All managers are surfaced as non-operational stubs so a single GDScript file can compile and run across platforms; calls emit `*_failed` signals.

# Examples

## Tilt-controlled camera with device motion

```gdscript
var motion := CMMotionManager.new()

func _ready() -> void:
    if not motion.is_device_motion_available:
        return
    motion.device_motion_update_interval = 1.0 / 60.0
    motion.device_motion_updated.connect(_on_device_motion)
    motion.update_failed.connect(func(msg): push_warning(msg))
    motion.start_device_motion_updates(CMMotionManager.XARBITRARY_Z_VERTICAL)

func _on_device_motion(m: CMDeviceMotion) -> void:
    # Use the quaternion directly to orient a Node3D
    $Camera3D.transform.basis = Basis(m.attitude_quaternion)
```

## Step counter

```gdscript
var pedometer := CMPedometer.new()

func _ready() -> void:
    if not CMPedometer.is_step_counting_available():
        return
    pedometer.pedometer_updated.connect(_on_pedometer_updated)
    pedometer.pedometer_failed.connect(func(msg): push_warning(msg))
    pedometer.start_updates(Time.get_unix_time_from_system())

func _on_pedometer_updated(data: CMPedometerData) -> void:
    print("Steps since start: ", data.number_of_steps)
```

## Querying historical activity

```gdscript
var activity := CMMotionActivityManager.new()

func dump_last_hour() -> void:
    if not CMMotionActivityManager.is_activity_available():
        return
    var now := Time.get_unix_time_from_system()
    activity.query_activity(now - 3600.0, now, func(activities, error):
        if error:
            push_warning(error)
            return
        for a in activities:
            print(a.start_date, " walking=", a.walking, " automotive=", a.automotive)
    )
```

## Head-tracked audio with AirPods

```gdscript
var headphones := CMHeadphoneMotionManager.new()

func _ready() -> void:
    headphones.device_motion_updated.connect(_on_head_motion)
    headphones.connected.connect(func(): print("AirPods connected"))
    headphones.disconnected.connect(func(): print("AirPods disconnected"))
    headphones.update_failed.connect(func(msg): push_warning(msg))
    headphones.start_device_motion_updates()

func _on_head_motion(m: CMDeviceMotion) -> void:
    $AudioListener.transform.basis = Basis(m.attitude_quaternion)
```
